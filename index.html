    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>How do you like your chicken? I am always in the quest for a great recipe. With winter very mild here in the
        South West, the warmth and rich winter fare is not so present in our dinner table. However, this recipe can
        transport to that cold weather vibe.

        An easy sauce that goes perfectly with chicken, mashed potatoes and even poached egg as something new and
        exciting. Do, however, make it at the last minute as the cream as a tendency to harden and you want it a bit
        runny. Delicious either way.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>2 shallots finely sliced</li>
        <li>1 garlic clove smashed</li>
        <li>3/4 cup white wine</li>
        <li>1 1/3 cup heavy cream</li>
        <li>3/4 cup frozen peas</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon chopped sage</li>
        <li>8 chicken tights, bone and skin on</li>
    
    </ul>

        <h2>Preparation</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Preheat oven at 350F.</li>
            <li>Remove all the extra fat from the chicken and place skin up in an ovenproof dish. Salt and pepper
                abundantly
                and sprinkle a bit of olive oil over the chicken. Bake in a hot oven for 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>In a large with high side pan, add the olive oil and saut√© the shallots, bacon, and garlic. Stir
                regularly.
                When the bacon is cooked to crisp add the wine and bring it to a boil. Lower the heat and simmer for 2
                minutes and reduce to half.</li>
            <li>Add the heavy cream and peas. Bring back to a boil before lowering the heat to a simmer. Simmer for 4
                minutes stirring occasionally. Add the sage and cook at low heat for another 2 minutes.</li>
        </ul>
